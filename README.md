**There are various tools that have been used throughout the project design and development:**
| Tools                                             | Usage                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Figma                                             | For referring to the product design specification |
| [TinyPng](https://tinypng.com/)                   | For JPEG/PNG Image Compression                    |
| [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) | For refining and compressing SVGs                 |

**The main concepts that have been emphasized are:**
1. Responsive Web Design
2. [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
3. [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

The website is using [BEM — Block Element Modifier](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) methodology to create reusable and understandable components in CSS. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting. We are also using [Nested BEM File structure organization](https://en.bem.info/methodology/filestructure/#nested) for CSS.
